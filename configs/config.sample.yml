# List of upstream node RPCs.
upstreams:
  # Each upstream can have the following keys:
  #
  # id - Unique identifier for the upstream.
  # httpURL - HTTP JSON RPC URL.
  # wsURL - Websocket URL.
  # basicAuth - Basic HTTP authentication username and password.
  # healthCheck - Health check-specific configuration.
  #   useWsForBlockHeight - Whether or not we subscribe to newHeads using
  #     websockets to detect the latest block height. This is preferred because
  #     it quickly updates the gateway with the latest block height. If this
  #     setting is undefined, the gateway will attempt to subscribe to new
  #     heads if the upstream supports it.
